# Java - Data Access Object (DAO)

Small project to consolidate knowledge in JDBC with MySQL and DAO project pattern.

## Important information to retain
```
- For each entitie there is an object responsible to acess data related to this entitie.
- Each DAO is defined by an interface.
- There will be specific classes to implement those interfaces.
- Dependency injection can be done by the Factory project pattern.
- This means that a class factory is responsible for creating multiple instances of that object.
```
