Java Web services project with Spring boot, RestAPIs and JPA/Hibernate
- User Insertion, Deletion, Order placing, Payment, etc... was tested using Postman
- Since Heroku is no longer free, won't be testing this with a dev profile but only with a test profile
- Technologies used: Spring boot, Maven, JPA/Hibernate, Rest APIs, H2 Database, SQL, XML, JAVA EE, Postman, XAMPP

### Notes to self:
- The basis for the project is created in [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and imported to Spring tool suite;
- To verify execution, go to localhost:8080;
- H2 is a java database that is usable and already built in;
- Everytime a new dependÃªncia is added to pom.xml, in Spring Tool Suite go to Project -> Clean to force Maven to download that dependency;
